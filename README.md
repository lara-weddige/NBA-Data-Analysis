# NBA-Data-Analysis
Analysis of NBA data from 1996 to 2022 covering player demographics, such as age, college attended, and country of origin, as well as performance statistics including points, rebounds, assists, games played, usage percentage, net rating, and many more to discover correlations, find trends, and explore the data to uncover any other (non-obvious) connections between variables. 


# Objective
This analysis aimed to dive deep into the data to better understand correlations between variables. 


# Key questions
Some of the hypotheses emerging from the available data are:
1. Does player age impact performance?
2. Has the country of origin changed over the course of the years 1996 to 2022?
3. How do more international players impact teamsâ€™ competitiveness?
4. How have colleges producing first-round draft picks changed over time?
5. Which players have the longest careers on average?
6. Which players have the most assists?
7. Is there an age at which rebounding performance changes? If so, when?
8. How is the amount of average points scored per game linked to age? To years in the league?
